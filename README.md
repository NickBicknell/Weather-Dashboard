# Weather-Dashboard

## Description 

I created a weather dashboard to see the current weather and an expected forecast of the next 5 days. The weather dashboard is a very useful application in everyday life to check the weather and plan your day accordingly depending on the weather. Creating this application, I gained even more knowledge of javascript and especially JQUERY since my whole script file was written with the API. I learned how to successfully fetch data through a server-side API and incorporate it throughout my webpage. I also gained better knowledge of generating elements and appending them together through javascipt.

## Usage

When you load up the webpage all that is shown is the header and a search bar (and possible search history if you have used the application before). You then enter any city into the search bar and hit the search button. Then a card of the current weather (including date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon of the current weather) is shown along with a 5 day forecast with the predicted weather of the next 5 days. Your search is saved to local storage and displayed under the search bar for an easy way to lookup that city in the future.
